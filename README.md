🥙 Shawarma Order Simulation

A simple and interactive JavaScript web app that simulates a shawarma ordering process using Promises and asynchronous logic. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 Features

📝 Take user orders via input field
⏳ Simulated preparation and serving time
⚡ Real-time status updates (no page reload)
❌ Error handling for invalid or out-of-stock orders
🧠 Demonstrates Promise chaining and async flow

🧠 How It Works

User enters a shawarma order and clicks the order button.

JavaScript validates the order using a Promise.

The app checks if ingredients are available.

Preparation and serving are simulated using setTimeout.

Order status is displayed step-by-step on the screen.

Errors are caught and shown when an item is unavailable or invalid.
